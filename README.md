## Getting started

### Installation

SwaggerIDE is currently hosted on [GitHub packages registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages).
For installing SwaggerIDE npm package from GitHub packages registry, create `.npmrc` file in your current directory and add
the following line to it:

```
@swagger-api:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

You can now install SwaggerIDE package using `npm`:

```sh
 $ npm install @swagger-api/swagger-ide
````

For more information about installing npm packages from GitHub packages registry please visit [Installing a package](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#installing-a-package)
section in their documentation.

### Usage

Install the package:

```sh
 $ npm install @swagger-api/swagger-ide
````

Use the package in you application:

**index.js**:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import SwaggerIDE from '@swagger-api/swagger-ide';
import '@swagger-api/swagger-ide/swagger-ide.css';

const MyApp = () => (
    <div>
      <h1>SwaggerIDE Integration</h1>
      <SwaggerIDE />
    </div>
);

self.MonacoEnvironment = {
    baseUrl: '/dist/', // we're building into the dist/ folder
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('swagger-ide'));
```

***webpack.config.js***

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
	mode: 'production',
	entry: {
		app: './index.js',
    'apidom.worker': '@swagger-api/swagger-ide/dist/esm/apidom.worker.js',
		'editor.worker': '@swagger-api/swagger-ide/dist/esm/editor.worker.js',
	},
	output: {
		globalObject: 'self',
		filename: '[name].js',
		path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
	},
	module: {
		rules: [
			{
				test: /\.css$/,
				use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
			}
		]
	}
};
```


## Development

### Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 16.13.0 and `npm >= 8.1.0` are the minimum required versions that this repo runs on.
We recommend using the latest version of Node.js@16 though. We're using [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) to build some fragments that require [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
[emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) or [docker](https://www.docker.com/) needs to be installed
on your operating system. We strongly recommend going with a docker option.

> Note: ApiDOM monorepo requires the use of `npm>=7.21.x`

### Setting up

If you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), running following command inside this repository
will automatically pick the right Node.js version for you:

```sh
 $ nvm use
```

Run the following commands to set up the repository for local development:

```sh
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
 $ npm i
 $ npm start
```

#### Setting up on MacOS

With the combination of MacOS and Node.js 16, there is a known compatibility issue of installing and building the `tree-sitter` dependency. The workaround is to globally install `>=npm@8.1.x` (for lerna/apidom monorepo) but use Node.js 14 to install/build tree-sitter.
Although the prerequisite is to use Node@16.13, at this point we don't rely on any specific feature from Node.js 16.13 (except for `>=npm@8.1.x`).

```sh
 $ npm install -g npm
 $ npm --version
```

Assuming we are using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions:

```sh
 $ nvm use v14
```

Then follow the installation steps above.

### npm scripts

**Lint**

```sh
 $ npm run lint
```

**Runs unit and integration tests**

```sh
 $ npm test
```

**Runs E2E Cypress tests**

Usage in **development** environment:

```sh
 $ npm run cy:dev
```

Usage in **Continuos Integration (CI)** environment:

```sh
 $ npm run cy:ci
```

**Build**

```sh
 $ npm run build
````

This script will build all the SwaggerIDE build artifacts - `app`, `esm` and `umd`.

### Build artifacts

After building artifacts, every two new directories will be created: `build/` and `dist/`.

**build/**

```sh
$ npm run build:app
$ npm run build:app:serve
```

Builds and serves standalone SwaggerIDE application and all it's assets on `http://localhost:3050/`.

**dist/esm/**

```sh
$ npm run build:bundle:esm
```

This bundle is suited for consumption by 3rd parties,
which want to use SwaggerIDE as a library in their own applications and have their own build process.

**dist/umd/**

```sh
$ npm run build:bundle:umd
```

SwaggerIDE UMD bundle exports SwaggerIDE symbol on global object.
It's bundled with React defined as external. This allows consumer to use his own version of React + ReactDOM and mount SwaggerIDe lazily.

    };
    const element = React.createElement(SwaggerIDE, props);
    const domContainer = document.querySelector('#swagger-ide');

    ReactDOM.render(element, domContainer);
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**npm**

SwaggerIDE is released as `@swagger-api/swagger-ide` npm package on [GitHub packages registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages).
Package can also be produced manually by running following commands (assuming you're already followed [setting up](#setting-up) steps):

```sh
 $ npm run build:bundle:esm
 $ npm run build:bundle:umd
 $ npm pack
```

### Package mapping

SwaggerIDE maps its [build artifacts](#build-artifacts) in `package.json` file in following way:

```json
"unpkg": "./dist/umd/swagger-ide.js",
"module": "./dist/esm/swagger-ide.js",
"browser": "./dist/esm/swagger-ide.js",
"jsnext:main": "./dist/esm/swagger-ide.js",
"exports": {
  "./package.json": "./package.json",
  ".": {
    "browser": "./dist/esm/swagger-ide.js"
  }
}
```

To learn more about these fields please refer to [webpack mainFields documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvemainfields)
or to [Node.js Modules: Packages documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/packages.html).

## Docker
Once we build the app, we can also build and run a Docker container.

```sh
 $ docker build . -t {{label}}
 $ docker run -p 8080:80 {{label}}
```

- {{label}} can be any descriptive string, e.g. `user/myapp-1`
- open browser at `localhost:8080`
