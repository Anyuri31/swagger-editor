# Swagger IDE

App will load with Monaco, Topbar, Swagger-UI (react).

Webpack and development setup based on Create React App (ejected)

## Prerequisites  
```
 "node": "~16.8",
 "npm": ">=7.21.0"
```

- if using MacOS, please refer to additional installation notes below  
- ApiDOM monorepo requires the use of `npm>=7.21.0`  

## Install

After cloning run the following commands to init and update `apidom` submodule

```sh
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
```

To update apidom submodule to latest commit, issue the following command:  

```sh
 $ git submodule update --recursive --remote
```

Change directory to `apidom` monorepo and run following commands:

```sh
 $ npm i
 $ npm run build
```

Now change to root directory and run the following commands  

```sh
 $ npm i
 $ npm start
```

Edit files in `./src` directory  

The default development port is `port=3000`. If a port is already in use, `npm start` will increment the port.  

### MacOS Install notes

With the combination of MacOS and Node.js 16, there is a known compatibility issue of installing and building the `tree-sitter` dependency. The workaround is to globally install `npm@7` (for lerna/apidom monorepo) but use Node.js 14 to install/build tree-sitter.  

Although the prerequisite is to use Node@16.8, at this point we don't rely on any specific feature from Node.js 16 (except for `npm@7`).  

```sh
 $ npm install -g npm
 $ npm --version 
```

Assuming we are using `NVM` to manage Node versions,  

```sh
 $ nvm use v14
```

Then follow the installation steps above  

## Test

Both Jest and Cypress include `@testing-library` plugin support.  

**Jest Unit Tests**
```sh
 $ npm test
```

**Cypress E2E Tests**


*Option 1a:* 
* `.env.development`  
* two terminal windows  
* Cypress headless mode  
* Cypress port=3000  
* Useful for quickly running Cypress tests while in development mode  

```sh
 $ npm start # terminal 1
 $ npm run test:cy:run # terminal 2
```

*Option 1b:*  
* `.env.development`  
* two terminal windows  
* Cypress interactive mode  
* Cypress port=3000  
* Useful for updating Cypress test(s) while already in development mode  

```sh
 $ npm start # terminal 1
 $ npm run test:cy:open # terminal 2
```

*Option 2a:*  
* `.env.test`  
* single terminal window  
* Cypress interactive mode  
* Cypress port=3260  
* Useful for working on adding/updating Cypress tests independent of development in `./src`  

```sh
 $ npm run test:cy:dev
```

*Option 2b:*  
* `.env.test`  
* single terminal window  
* Cypress headless mode  
* Cypress port=3260  
* Useful settings and environment variables appropriate for CI

```sh
 $ npm run test:cy:ci
```

## build
This script will build and serve a gzipped static build at `localhost:3050`.  

```sh
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve-static-build
```

## Docker
Once we build the app, we can also build and run a Docker container.  

```sh
 $ docker build . -t {{label}} 
 $ docker run -p 8080:80 {{label}} 
```

- {{label}} can be any descriptive string, e.g. `user/myapp-1`  
- open browser at `localhost:8080`
